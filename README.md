# Quadra Ground Control Software

**Quadra** is an open-source UAV ground control software developed in **C++** to serve as a **free guide, resource, and awareness tool** for UAV enthusiasts, students, and professionals. It aims to make advanced UAV control technology more accessible and transparent.

Quadra offers a modern and intuitive control experience for drones and VTOLs. It features AI-powered voice assistance and multi-UAV management capabilities, enabling users to experiment, learn, and innovate in the field of UAV technology.

Originally developed for the **Teknofest High School UAV Competition**, the project has since been reimagined as a community-focused, open-source initiative. The software has been **rewritten two times** to ensure better performance, maintainability, and scalability.

## About Me

I'm an **independent developer** focused on **UAV systems**, **low-level programming**, **reverse engineering**, and **cybersecurity**. I started working on Quadra for the **Teknofest High School UAV Competition**, but it soon evolved into a great passion.

My goal is to create an **open-source UAV control system** that can become a global standard. I believe in learning by doing, and Quadra is a result of that belief.

While developing this software, I struggled to find sufficient resources, so I developed Quadra — not just to overcome this challenge but to help others progress faster and further. My aim is to raise awareness about UAV technology and make it more accessible to everyone.

## Mission & Vision

The primary goal of Quadra is to provide:  
- **A Free Guide**: Empower users to learn about UAV control systems and development of ground control stations.
- **An Open Resource**: Provide an open-source tool for students, hobbyists, and developers.  
- **Awareness & Accessibility**: Increase awareness of UAV technology and make it more accessible to a wider audience.

By sharing this project, I hope to support innovation, experimentation, and education in UAV systems.

## Features

- **Mission Planning for VTOL & Drones**: Create, edit, and execute missions for both drones and VTOLs.  
- **One-Click Action Buttons**: Trigger critical commands instantly with simple, accessible buttons.  
- **AI-Powered Voice Assistant**: Control UAVs with natural voice commands for an enhanced user experience.  
- **Parameter Monitoring & Configuration**: View and edit UAV parameters in real-time.  
- **Multi-UAV Connection & Management**: Connect and control multiple UAVs simultaneously.  
- **Live Map**: Plan and adjust missions or manage connected systems directly on an interactive map.
